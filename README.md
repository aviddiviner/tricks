# tricks [![GoDoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/aviddiviner/tricks?status.svg)](https://godoc.org/github.com/aviddiviner/tricks)

An entirely unidiomatic approach to working with maps and slices in Go.

## What is this?

Originally started as an exercise in teaching myself Go reflection, I got a little carried away... and created something _awesome_. This goes out to all those Gophers with a yearning in their hearts for the good old days of chaining long strings of methods together (Ã  la Ruby).

### Show me examples!

Sure. The best place to start is probably [the docs](https://godoc.org/github.com/aviddiviner/tricks), but here's some sexy code to admire:

```go
animals := []string{"dog", "cat", "bear", "cow", "bull", "pig", "iguana"}
bearCow := tricks.Slice(animals).
    Map(strings.ToUpper).
    Last(5).
    First(2).
    Value().([]string) // [BEAR COW]
```

```go
// TODO: More, and better examples.
```

### TL;DR

<details>
<summary>`slice.` `All`, `Any`, `Many`, `One`, `None`</summary>These take a `func(T) bool` and tell you whether the elements in the slice: all return true, any return true, more than one returns true, exactly one returns true, or none return true.

</details><details>
<summary>`slice.` `Sort`, `Min`, `Max`</summary>Sort the elements of the slice. Find the smallest or biggest values. As long as the slice is a normal type (`[]string`, `[]int`, etc.) or it implements `sort.Interface`, these all work.

</details><details>
<summary>`slice.` `Map`, **`Reduce`**</summary>The classics. Apply a `func(T) X` to every element of the slice and create a new slice `[]X` of the results. Reduce all the elements down to a single value by some `func(a, b T) T`.

</details><details>
<summary>`slice.` `First`, `Last`</summary>Reslice to only take the first or last `n` elements.

</details><details>
<summary>`slice.` **`SortBy`**</summary>Sort elements by some `func(a, b T) bool` that returns whether element `a < b`.

</details><details>
<summary>`slice.` `GroupBy`</summary>Apply a `func(V) K` to every element of the slice and group them into a map (`map[K][]V`) of the results.

</details><details>
<summary>`slice.` `Reverse`, `Flatten`, `Join`</summary>Reverse the order of elements in the slice. Flatten a nested slice of slices into a one-dimensional slice. Join a slice of strings into a single string.

</details><details>
<summary>`slice.` `Len`, `Copy`, `Value`</summary>Get the number of elements in the slice. Copy the contents to a new underlying slice. Get the underlying slice value.

</details>

<details>
<summary>`map.` `Keys`, `Values`</summary>Get a slice of only the key or values of the map.

</details><details>
<summary>`map.` `Only`</summary>Get a map containing only the entries matching some list of keys.

</details><details>
<summary>`map.` `Len`, `Copy`, `Value`</summary>Get the number of elements in the map. Copy the contents to a new underlying map. Get the underlying map value.

</details>

## Why did you do this?

**(The back-story.)**

So, there I was one day, merrily coding in Go. Feeling so productive, and happy with my life, I examined a piece of code I had just written. I had some logs which I'd read off disk, and I wanted to group them by date, and only take the last few days (with maybe an offset to paginate them). So I looked at my code:

```go
func groupLogsByDate(logs []Timelog, amount, offset int) map[string][]Timelog {
    // Group the logs by date, into a map
    grouped := make(map[string][]Timelog)
    for _, log := range logs {
        day := log.Start.AsDate()
        grouped[day] = append(grouped[day], log)
    }

    // Get all the unique days, and sort them
    var days []string
    for day := range grouped {
        days = append(days, day)
    }
    sort.Strings(days)

    // Get only the days we want
    if amount+offset < len(days) {
        days = days[len(days)-(amount+offset):]
    }
    if amount < len(days) {
        days = days[:amount]
    }

    // Return a map of logs for the chosen days
    result := make(map[string][]Timelog)
    for _, day := range days {
        result[day] = grouped[day]
    }
    return result
}
```

I was _pleased_, and filled with a warm, fuzzy love for Go. So simple, and clear. _Finish en klaar._

But yet... I didn't feel complete. I felt like I wanted more. I longed for the excitement of mapping, filtering, sorting, reducing, grouping... maybe all in one long line that does _all of the things_. I wanted a little box of tricks that I could use to just chain everything together and make **âœ¨magicâœ¨** happen.

I mean, all I really had to do was:

1. Group the logs into a map
1. Get the map's keys
1. Sort them
1. Take the last/first few
1. Return a map with those keys

That should be like 5 lines of code, right? I mean, it used to be that way... in _Ruby_.

_"No!"_ I told myself. _"This is not Ruby! This is a grown-up language. Used by grown-ups. For big, serious, grown-up things!"_ ... _"Go is this way for a **reason**."_

So I went to bed that night, wrestling with my feelings of inner turmoil. I couldn't quiet that little inner voice. I knew it had to be possible. Go has function literals, right. Go has reflection. This must be possible. There must be a way to have my cake _and_ eat it.

Well... it turns out there was a way, and I found it. And you just found it too. I woke up early the next morning and, after much `reflect`-ing, I emerged with this thing of beauty:

```go
func groupLogsByDate(logs []Timelog, amount, offset int) map[string][]Timelog {
    grouped := tricks.Slice(logs).
        GroupBy(func(t Timelog) string { return t.Start.AsDate() })
    days := grouped.Keys().
        Sort().
        Last(amount + offset).
        First(amount)
    return grouped.
        Only(days).
        Value().(map[string][]Timelog)
}
```

And then promptly rewrote it like this:

```go
func groupLogsByDate(logs []Timelog, amount, offset int) map[string][]Timelog {
    grouped := tricks.Slice(logs).GroupBy(func(t Timelog) string { return t.Start.AsDate() })
    return grouped.Only(grouped.Keys().Sort().Last(amount + offset).First(amount)).Value().(map[string][]Timelog)
}
```

**ðŸ¤˜YEAAA!ðŸ¤˜** Now that's what I'm talking about! I felt the mad rush of power from chaining all those methods and now I was _truly pleased_. I slept well that night, knowing I had done a bad thing, but still, feeling damn good about it.

## So, should I actually use this?

Probably not.

If you're working on a big project, or if someone else has to maintain your code, certainly not. Having said that though... there's nothing _technically_ wrong with what I've done here. And you must admit, it _is_ pretty awesome. So, if you like writing less code, looking cool in front of your friends, and building things _super fast_ with your âœ¨magicalâœ¨ new code skills, then you know what to do. `go get` 'em.

### Seriously though, why should or shouldn't I use this?

To my mind, it's a choice between a declarative vs. imperative style.

The declarative style is more _expressive_. We improve readability by simply reducing the code on the page, keeping things short and to the point. This makes it easier to parse what is intended (vs. what is actually being done).

The imperative style is more _accurate_. Readability is gained from code that is clear and precise (as Go usually is). You can see exactly what is being done, and understand the inner workings of each piece. This usually makes for more efficient code too.

I feel that **tricks** makes it easier to write less, and be more expressive, at the cost of reduced accuracy.

But yes, please only use this in your pet projects. You don't want to take a dependency on a single package that changes how your code is structured in such a fundamental way. This forces everyone else to learn how some crazy package works just to maintain your code. Rather keep things plain and idiomatic.

Interestingly, there are some nice new features coming in Go 1.8 which do things similar to what I've done here, like [`sort.Slice`](https://tip.golang.org/pkg/sort/#Slice). So there is a balance to be struck between these two styles. Hopefully this package can inspire some people, and maybe more of these tricks will slowly be superseded by conveniences from the Go core.
